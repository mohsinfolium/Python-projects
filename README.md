# Python Basics Project

This project serves as a showcase of fundamental Python programming concepts, emphasizing practical implementations and readability. It also highlights the integration of version control using GitHub, providing a sample repository for reference.

## Key Features

### 1. **Variables**

- Demonstrates how to define and use variables for storing and manipulating data.
- Examples include:
  - Assigning values to variables.
  - Updating and reassigning variable values.
  - Performing arithmetic and string operations using variables.

### 2. **Loops**

- Implements iteration techniques using both `for` and `while` loops.
- Examples include:
  - Iterating over lists and dictionaries.
  - Using loops to calculate sums, averages, and factorials.
  - Implementing nested loops for complex operations.

### 3. **Lists**

- Covers the creation, manipulation, and traversal of lists.
- Examples include:
  - Adding, removing, and updating elements in a list.
  - Sorting and reversing lists.
  - Using list comprehensions for concise data transformations.

### 4. **Functions**

- Defines reusable functions to modularize and structure the code.
- Examples include:
  - Functions with parameters and return values.
  - Default arguments and keyword arguments.
  - Recursive functions for tasks like calculating Fibonacci sequences.

### 5. **File Handling**

- Explores Python's file handling capabilities for reading, writing, and managing files.
- Includes robust error handling for file operations.
- Example script:

#### File Handling Script

```python
# Script to read a .txt file and print each line

def read_file(file_path):
    """
    Reads a text file and prints its contents line by line.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the .txt file.

    Returns:
        None
    """
    try:
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            for line in file:
                print(line.strip())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: The file at '{file_path}' was not found.")

# Example usage
read_file('example.txt')
```

### 6. **Error Handling**

- Incorporates error-handling mechanisms to ensure the code runs smoothly and handles unexpected situations gracefully.
- Examples include:
  - Catching exceptions for invalid input or missing files.
  - Using `try-except` blocks to provide meaningful error messages.
